RSNET is a MATLAB program for inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) from gene expression dataset based on redundancy silencing and network enhancement technique. In RSNET algorithm, highly dependent nodes are constrained in the model as network enhancement items to enhance real interactions and dimension of putative interactions is reduced adaptively to remove weak and indirect connections.
